## SWOT Analysis

### Structure

| | Helpful | Harmful |
|---|---------|---------|
| **Internal** | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| **External** | Opportunities | Threats |

### Application
1. List 3-5 items per quadrant
2. Prioritize by impact
3. Match strengths to opportunities
4. Address weaknesses that amplify threats

---

## OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

### Structure

**Objective**: Qualitative, inspirational goal
- Key Result 1: Quantitative measure
- Key Result 2: Quantitative measure
- Key Result 3: Quantitative measure

### Best Practices
- 3-5 objectives per quarter
- 2-4 key results per objective
- Key results should be measurable
- 70% achievement = healthy stretch
- 100% achievement = not ambitious enough

### Example

**Objective**: Become the leading design tool for collaboration

- KR1: Increase daily active users from 100K to 250K
- KR2: Achieve NPS score of 60+
- KR3: Launch real-time collaboration feature

## OODA Loop

### Phases

1. **Observe**: Gather information about the situation
2. **Orient**: Analyze and synthesize observations
3. **Decide**: Choose a course of action
4. **Act**: Execute the decision

### When to Use
- Fast-paced competitive situations
- Crisis management
- Iterative improvement cycles

### Key Insight
> Speed through the loop creates competitive advantage. The faster you can complete cycles, the more adaptive you become.

## Eisenhower Matrix

### Quadrants

|  | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|---|--------|------------|
| **Important** | DO: Crisis, deadlines | SCHEDULE: Planning, prevention |
| **Not Important** | DELEGATE: Interruptions | ELIMINATE: Time wasters |

### Application Rules
- Quadrant 1: Handle immediately
- Quadrant 2: Block dedicated time (most valuable work)
- Quadrant 3: Find someone else or batch
- Quadrant 4: Stop doing entirely

## Two-Way Door Framework

Source: Jeff Bezos / Amazon

### One-Way Doors (Type 1)
- Irreversible or very costly to reverse
- Require careful analysis
- Need ~90% confidence before proceeding
- Examples: Major acquisitions, platform changes, hiring key executives

### Two-Way Doors (Type 2)
- Easily reversible
- Can course-correct quickly
- Need only ~70% confidence
- Examples: Feature experiments, pricing tests, UI changes

### Decision Rule
> "Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you're probably being slow."

## RAPID Decision Framework

For clarity on decision-making roles:

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **R**ecommend | Proposes the decision, gathers input |
| **A**gree | Must agree before decision proceeds |
| **P**erform | Executes the decision |
| **I**nput | Consulted for expertise |
| **D**ecide | Has final authority |

### Usage
- Assign exactly one D per decision
- Minimize A's to avoid gridlock
- Document roles before contentious decisions

---

## Pre-Mortem Analysis

### Process
1. Imagine the project has failed spectacularly
2. Each team member writes reasons for failure
3. Share and discuss potential failure modes
4. Develop mitigation strategies

### Benefits
- Surfaces risks psychological safety might hide
- Legitimizes pessimism constructively
- Creates actionable prevention plans
