# Indie App Marketing

Strategic marketing frameworks for indie developers and bootstrapped apps. Extracted from Jordan Morgan's Swiftjective-C (2025).

## Core Philosophy

### The Visibility Problem

A great app that nobody knows about is still a great app that nobody knows about. Without an audience, even stellar apps fail commercially. Marketing feels uncomfortable initially, but treating it with the same rigor as coding accelerates growth.

### Vibe Marketing

Embrace action over perfection. Put together creatives and run paid ads even without knowing best practices. There's too much to learn academically—try something and learn on the job.

The underlying principle: it's not the mistakes that will kill you, it's the not trying.

## Strategic Frameworks

### 1. Business vs Boutique

Run two types of projects:

**Business App**: Prioritizes growth, revenue, scalability. Funds everything else.

**Boutique App**: Creative playground without commercial pressure. Permits exhaustive polish, aggressive adoption of new frameworks, prioritizing technical novelty over market demands.

Prerequisites for boutique work:
- Financial stability from the business app
- Clear definition of functionality and target audience upfront

### 2. Marketing Time Allocation

Rebalance time as an indie developer:
- Aim for 50/50 split between marketing and product work
- Minimum acceptable: 60/40 ratio (development/marketing)
- Institute structured "Mon/Tue marketing flow" with development-focused remaining days

Marketing must become a first-class component of how you operate.

## Tactical Playbook

### Email Marketing (High Priority)

1. Email audiences demonstrate high purchasing intent (conscious opt-in)
2. Integrate signup form during app onboarding (around slide 3-4)
3. Use any email platform with API access (Mailerlite recommended)
4. Build list before you need it

### Paid Acquisition

**Getting Started:**
- Budget at least $30 daily for a full month minimum
- Expect initial campaign setup to be challenging
- Start with $10 boosts on Instagram posts showing the app naturally
- Use Apple Search Ads for exact match keywords

**Tracking:**
- Maintain spreadsheet: dates, ads, spending, revenue
- Track cost per install, LTV, creative performance
- Don't run campaigns "on vibes"—measure everything

**Meta Ads:**
- Drive traffic to well-designed landing pages
- Landing pages sell the experience better than app store listings

### Lead Generation

- Launch free web tools with email capture mechanisms
- Leverage viral potential to drive funnel entry
- Example: "Thompson Twins Workout" free tool drove signups

### Organic Content

- Share authentic, unpolished feature demonstrations
- Don't wait for perfect marketing materials
- Pause development temporarily—dedicate a month to pure marketing

## Case Study: Elite Hoops

### Tactics Used

1. **Agency Partnership**: Hired EVO Marketing for positioning, competitor analysis, 20 video ads, campaign optimization training

2. **Lead Gen Tool**: Free web workout tool with email capture

3. **Structured Schedule**: Mon/Tue marketing, Wed-Fri development

### Results (One Month)

| Metric | Start | End | Change |
|--------|-------|-----|--------|
| Subscribers | 1,988 | 2,220 | +232 |
| MRR | $7,633 | $8,775 | +$1,142 |
| Trials | 175 | 193 | +18 |

### Lessons Learned

**What Worked:**
- Agency partnership for strategic positioning
- Lead generation tools with email capture
- Natural growth during in-season period

**What Didn't Work:**
- Planned content calendar (failed to execute)
- Running ads without metrics understanding
- "Instinctive" ad management

## Key Principles

1. **Start Small**: $10/day experiments teach more than theory

2. **Measure Everything**: Spreadsheet tracking is non-negotiable

3. **Marketing = Development**: Both are critical indie skills

4. **Action Over Perfection**: Iterate toward what resonates

5. **Build Audience First**: List building precedes product launches
