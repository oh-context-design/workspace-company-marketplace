## Dylan Field - Product-Led Growth

Source: Sequoia Capital Spotlight

### Core Principles

1. **Product Excellence Over Marketing**
   > "To overcome the skepticism, Figma couldn't just be good. It had to be _undeniably_ good"
   - ~2.5-year development cycle (2013-2015) reflected commitment to excellence over speed

2. **Creating Advocates Over Customers**

   - Margins for error are nonexistent

3. **Controlling Inputs, Empowering Outputs**

   - Trust hired talent to execute within boundaries
   - Evaluate solutions collaboratively rather than prescriptively

## Jeff Bezos - Day 1 Culture

Source: AWS Executive Insights

### Core Principles

1. **Customer Obsession**
   > "Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust."
   - 90% of AWS features originate from direct customer feedback
   - 10% comes from anticipating unstated customer needs
   - Avoid inventing in isolation; let customer pain points drive innovation

2. **Long-Term Focus Over Short-Term Profit**
   > "We are internally driven to improve our services, adding benefits and features, before we have to."
   - Lower prices and increase value proactively
   - Invent ahead of market demand
   - Resist Day 2 mentality: stasis → irrelevance → decline

3. **High-Velocity Decision-Making**

   **Two-Pizza Teams:**
   - Small groups (≤10 people) fed by two pizzas
   - Single-threaded ownership of one service
   - Reduces bureaucratic overhead; accelerates iterations

   **One-Way vs. Two-Way Doors:**
   - One-way: irreversible, requires 90% certainty (e.g., building infrastructure)
   - Two-way: reversible, requires ~70% confidence (e.g., A/B testing features)
   - Encourage risk-taking on reversible decisions

4. **Bold Innovation & Experimentation**
   - "Be brave enough to fail" if lessons improve future customer value
   - Resist complacency; yesterday's "wow" becomes today's "ordinary"
   - Stay externally focused on trends; avoid internal-only optimization

### Anti-Day 2 Guardrails

| Day 2 Warning Sign | Day 1 Counter |
|---|---|
| Slowed decision-making | Decentralized ownership |
| Multiple approval layers | Two-pizza team autonomy |
| Inward focus on margins | External obsession with customers |
| Risk aversion | Experimental bias toward reversible bets |

## Application Framework

### When Making Strategic Decisions

1. **Empty Chair Test** (Bezos): What would the customer want?
2. **Day 1 Check** (Bezos): Is this Day 1 or Day 2 behavior?
3. **Input Control** (Field): Are we controlling inputs or chasing outputs?
4. **Advocate Creation** (Field): Will this create advocates or just users?
5. **Long-term Vision** (Cook): Does this serve long-term growth?
